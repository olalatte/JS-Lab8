Reports are being used to make crucial company decisions. Your reputation is on the line to be sure of the accuracy of the data being reported. It is critical that you have confidence in your data pipeline execution.\nYour data pipelines are complex and changing often. Regressions are possible from minor changes to DAGs and tasks. This may have unintended impacts on tables, and data flow which may not be discovered until much later and data has been already used in reports. Also, failure and DAG outages occur. You need confidence that when failures are fixed, that data is ‘flowing’ again and things are back to normal. Finally, complex ETL demands accuracy when data is mission critical. How do you know that your ETL is copying all rows accurately? That your joins are not dropping any data?\nThis training gives you practical, real-world examples of tests that can be added to any data pipeline to provide you with the confidence that things are working as expected.\nWhat will I learn?\nThe class will include hands-on activities and provide pseudo-code examples of tests that can be run against your tables and data models. You will learn about the different classes of tests, how to set them up, and the important metrics to monitor.\nHow will this help my company and me?\nAccurate business decisions, confidence that data quality is valid, and no more guesswork or surprises about data quality. Sounds great, right? Once you’re freed from worrying and fighting fires, you can refocus on your being creative with your data and have the confidence to make changes.\n",

We propose digging deeper to understand not simply the most engaged users, but those who’ve found something in your product that transforms the way they think. In this talk, we’ll share how our data science and research team worked collaboratively to conduct retention analysis, customer segmentation, and cohort definitions. Together we uncovered a group of users who’ve used UserTesting to democratize research and change their company culture. These are the customers we want to serve and replicate. This research has allowed us to make more informed and confident decisions about our product vision and roadmap.How to Partner with Research and Data to Define Product Strategyby Aigerim ShormanSetting product strategy that is inspiring, aligned with the company vision and impactful is really hard. Too often we set strategies based on quantitative data alone or on existing team priorities. In this talk, I will share how we pivoted our entire team's strategy based on broad fundamental research, combined with data trends and company priorities. We ended up uncovering new and exciting opportunities that we would have never thought about from behind our desks.____ABOUT THE SPEAKERSAigerim Shorman - Product Lead at FacebookAigerim is a Product Lead for the Profile team at Facebook, where she is leading team of 7 Product Managers, focused on helping 2B people craft their online identity. Prior to joining Facebook, Aigerim was Founder and CEO of Triptrotting, a Google Ventures backed startup based in San Francisco. Aigerim was named as one of the top 10 women founders to watch on Google Ventures CEOs list and has spoken at many tech events including Women 2.0, USC Annenberg School of Communication, Product School and others.Marieke McCloskey - Director of Research at UserTestingMarieke leads the Product Insights Team at UserTesting, where she leverages the best of Data Science and UX Research. She loves teaching others to do research so they can validate their decisions early and often.Doug Puett - Head of Data Science at UserTestingAt UserTesting, Doug focuses on using quantitative methods to develop an organization-wide understanding of how great products and experiences contribute to long-lasting customer growth and value.____THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: \n",

We will learn how to code Naive Bayes to classify text documents, such as whether a news article is \"sports\" or \"business\". You'll learn how Naive Bayes works, where it can be used, and you'll get a chance to run it on real text data. We’ll be doing hands-on coding in Python. You’ll leave this session equipped to apply this classification technique to other text datasets. \n\nPrerequisites:\nThis event is intended for beginner to intermediate data science students. People who have done a little machine learning before and want to add Natural Language Processing to their data science toolbox. It does not require in-depth knowledge of statistics or probability.  If you have never seen Python before, never fear! Beginners are welcome to come to listen, learn, and observe. If you've already got some familiarity with Python, you’ll get more out the workshop! Participants who are familiar with concepts of data analysis, statistics, and probability will be better equipped to apply their skills after the conclusion of this meetup. \n\nWhat to Bring:\nBring your laptop and charger. All course materials will be online.\n\nWhat You’ll Learn:\n\n\nWhat is Bayes Theorem and why it's useful\n\n\nHow the Naive Bayes algorithm extends from Bayes Theorem\n\n\nHow to build a Naive Bayes algorithm to classify text\n\n\nHow to evaluate our classifier’s performance\n\n\nWhich resources to continue to develop your skills\n\n\n\nSchedule:\n6:00 pm – Doors open & Networking\n6:30 pm – Lesson Kickoff\n6:45 pm – Introduction to machine learning\n7:15 pm - Introduction to the Naive Bayes for text classification\n8:30 pm – Wrap-Up\n\nMeet Your Instructor:\nDr. Brian Spiering is a Professor of Computer Science at the University of San Francisco and freelance consultant.

In addition to getting 12 hours of instructor led curriculum, you will also receive a copy of \"Deep Learning with Python.\" \nMain Topics:\nDuring this course on deep learning, you will learn how to build neural networks from scratch. We will discuss the math involved, which includes calculus, linear algebra, and probability theory, so you'll be able to understand how your model works at a fundamental level.\nYou will start by building a single-neuron network and gradually build larger and more complex models able to predict more complex phenomenon. We will then learn about Keras and TensorFlow and use those tools to build out our deep learning models rapidly.\nWe will be building fully connected networks (multilayered perceptrons), convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN). In addition, we will be leveraging Transfer Learning along with models like ResNet or Inception, to help boost the predictive power of the network. These models will allow us to predict continuous values or classify images, text or audio.\nDuring the course, you'll learn about how to build a deep learning pipeline, which includes:\n\n\nAcquiring data\n\n\nCleaning data\n\n\nNormalizing data\n\n\nSplitting data into test, train, and validation\n\n\nModel training\n\n\nEpochs and Batches\n\n\nLoss functions and Gradient Descent\n\n\nOptimizers\n\n\nValidation metrics\n\n\nYou will be shown how to train your models locally and in the cloud using Amazon Web Services' Tesla GPUs.\nOverall, at the conclusion of the course, you will have a firm understanding of neural networks and their design, with the ability to design and build your own.\n\n\nPrerequisites:\n- Bring a Laptop (Either a Mac, Linux or a Windows machine running Linux in a VM)- Generally comfortable with mathematics\n\nSetup:\n• Bring your laptop with latest Python installed and power cable.\n\n\nQuestions:\nIf you have questions, or simply want to make sure that this workshop is for you, please reach out to us at learn@galvanize.com.",

His contributions to modern systems of typography and iconography represent a paradigm shift in visual language; Sutnar deconstructed large quantities of convoluted data, then reconstructed the information to read as quickly and clearly as possible. We’ll feature both his early work from Prague (book designs and housewares), and his later work in New York including theoretical treatises and exquisite industrial catalogs for Sweets. As a bonus, you’ll discover the origin of putting telephone area codes in parentheses.\nDoors at 6:00pm.
