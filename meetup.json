For this event, we have invited speakers from different companies and tech communities to talk about their personal journey into data science and beyond and share some lessons they've learned along the way.</p> <p>We'll have food and non-alcoholic drinks beginning at 6:00 PM. Please aim to arrive before 6:30 PM as we'll begin the talks at that time. Bringing a friend? Please register for them, as well.</p> <p>6:00 Doors open<br/>6:30 Welcome from WiMLDS, PyLadies SF, DoorDash<br/>6:40 Talks by Melanie Warrick, Kasia Rachuta, Raquel Araujo<br/>8:00 Panel discussion with the speakers and invited guests, socializing<br/>9:00 Doors close</p> <p>Speakers and invited panelists:<br/>Melanie Warrick (Developer Relations Engineer for AI and the Cloud at Google)<br/>Kasia Rachuta (Data Scientist at Medium)<br/>Raquel Araujo (Product Scientist at Indeed)<br/>Jessica Lachs (Head of Analytics Team at DoorDash)<br/>Grishma Jena (Cognitive Software Engineer at IBM Watson)<br/>Paula Alves (Data Scientist at DigiSight)</p> <p>Moderator: Dawn Lu, Data Scientist at DoorDash</p> <p>Abstracts &amp; Bios<br/>Talk: Tech career path advice (Melanie Warrick)<br/>I've worked in many companies and industries and my path into technology has not been a straight line. I am sharing what I've experienced developing my career and advice that has helped me get where I am now. The goal is to get you thinking about your career paths in ways you haven't considered.</p> <p>Melanie Warrick is a Developer Relations Engineer for AI and the Cloud at Google and speaks a lot about AI and ML. She was a founding engineer on a deep learning platform prior to Google and worked on machine learning engineering at Change.org. In another life she had a comprehensive consulting career, as an IC and leading teams both domestic and international and before that she was working behind the scenes in the film industry. In her spare time, she sleeps.</p> <p>Talk: From physics to data science - a numbers journey (Kasia Rachuta)<br/>In this talk, I will discuss my path of moving into a career in data science. Prior to starting my career in tech, I worked for the UK equivalent of the National Science Foundation; completed a couple of internships in social impact measurement and volunteered in Spain, Kenya and London. After I finished my master's, I decided to try something new and that's how I found myself in data science. I will cover being self-taught and what resources have helped me to get where I am, as well as touch on the importance of mentorship and advocating for yourself.</p> <p>Kasia Rachuta works as a Data Scientist at Medium. She has a Master’s in theoretical physics from University College London and after graduation, she moved to San Francisco from London. In her spare time, she enjoys volunteering for women-related organizations and diversity causes, scuba diving and traveling. Kasia is also a San Francisco PyLadies organizer.</p> <p>Talk: What I learned from every job I held and how that shaped who I am today (Raquel Araujo)<br/>My journey into data science was not a typical one. But whose is it, anyway? When I was looking for a job in a tech company, I had to market myself as ready for the industry after spending several years in academia. At the same time, I had to learn to navigate the previously unknown (to me) whiteboard interviews, homework assignments, coding challenges, etc. I want to share what I learned from every step in my (still early-ish) career with other people who may find themselves in a similar situation.</p> <p>Raquel Araujo works at Indeed as a Product Scientist in the Applicant Quality team after working as a Business Intelligence Analyst. After trying to be an Economics PhD student, she found a job in analytics and never looked back.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Intermix.io presents a special 1-hour online training that introduces you to strategies and best practices for adding data validation tests and data quality monitoring to the tables in your data lake and data warehouse.</p> <p>*** To receive the link to the webinar, please register on Eventbrite: <a href=\"http://nter.mx/data-lake-quaility-meetup\" class=\"linkified\">http://nter.mx/data-lake-quaility-meetup</a> ***</p> <p>*** If you can’t make this time, no worries. Register anyway, and we’ll send the recording and the slides afterward.</p> <p>Why this training<br/>The data in your data warehouse is mission critical. Reports are being used to make crucial company decisions. Your reputation is on the line to be sure of the accuracy of the data being reported. It is critical that you have confidence in your data pipeline execution.</p> <p>Your data pipelines are complex and changing often. Regressions are possible from minor changes to DAGs and tasks. This may have unintended impacts on tables, and data flow which may not be discovered until much later and data has been already used in reports. Also, failure and DAG outages occur. You need confidence that when failures are fixed, that data is ‘flowing’ again and things are back to normal. Finally, complex ETL demands accuracy when data is mission critical. How do you know that your ETL is copying all rows accurately? That your joins are not dropping any data?</p> <p>This training gives you practical, real-world examples of tests that can be added to any data pipeline to provide you with the confidence that things are working as expected.</p> <p>What will I learn?<br/>The class will include hands-on activities and provide pseudo-code examples of tests that can be run against your tables and data models. You will learn about the different classes of tests, how to set them up, and the important metrics to monitor.</p> <p>How will this help my company and me?<br/>Accurate business decisions, confidence that data quality is valid, and no more guesswork or surprises about data quality. Sounds great, right? Once you’re freed from worrying and fighting fires, you can refocus on your being creative with your data and have the confidence to make changes.</p> ",

There is a very common misconception and it is that machine learning is a complicated subject, only accessible to those with high programming and mathematical skills.

        "description": "<p>Kubernauts!</p> <p>We are excited to announce the next San Francisco Kubernetes meetup will be June 14, 2018 at Microsoft's Reactor in San Francisco.</p> <p>If you want to host or speak at the K8s community meetups, please reach out to me via email ([masked]) or Twitter (@baldwinmathew).</p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>6:30 - 7:00 - Social</p> <p>7:00 - 7:30 - Agones: Scaling Multiplayer Game Servers with Open Source - Mark Mandel, Google</p> <p>Awesome! You’ve built the next big FPS or MMO multiplayer game! You have a game client and a dedicated game server binary ready for players to connect to, but now you’ve got to write code to spin up game server processes, fire up machines to run them, autoscale them, and so much more!</p> <p>Thankfully, there are multiple open source projects that are available to do much of this work for you, and get your multiplayer game up and running at global scale as fast as possible.</p> <p>In this talk we’ll discuss and demo the open source project Agones, currently being developed by Google Cloud Platform in conjunction with Ubisoft. Built on top of the open source, software container orchestration system Kubernetes, it provides a batteries-included solution for running dedicated game servers at scale anywhere - be-it in the cloud, on your own hardware, or across all of the above.</p> <p>7:30 - 8:00 - Debugging Cloud-Native Applications with the Conduit Service Mesh - Franziska von der Goltz, Buoyant</p> <p>In this talk, we dive into how a service mesh can be used for debugging microservices. A service mesh is an increasingly popular way to add reliability, security, and visibility to a cloud-native application. While service meshes provide a wealth of features, including service discovery, load balancing, retries, and timeouts, one primary benefit they bring is in instrumentation and telemetry about the application. We demonstrate how this data can be used to address critical debugging problems that are unique to microservices, by giving you a view into service behavior across the entire infrastructure without needing to change application code.</p> <p>8:00 - 8:30 Social, Wrap-up, Jet</p> <p>Bio/Briefs(s)</p> <p>Mark Mandel is a Developer Advocate for Google Cloud Platform, founder of the open source, multiplayer dedicated game server scaling project Agones and one half of the Google Cloud Platform Podcast. Hailing from Australia, Mark built his career developing backend systems and writing open source software.</p> <p>Twitter: @Neurotic</p> <p>Franziska von der Goltz is a software engineer working on open-source service mesh technology at Buoyant. Prior to Buoyant, she was a part of the education team at the Hackbright Academy in San Francisco, an engineering school for women with a mission to change the ratio in the tech industry. She loves traveling and enjoys tea.</p> <p>Twitter: @franziskagoltz</p> <p>Location/Instructions:</p> <p>Microsoft Reactor<br/>680 Folsom<br/>Ground Floor<br/>San Francisco, CA</p> ",

But how many organizations actually ensure their values are both understood and meaningful to their employees?</p> <p>Humans not Resources, partnered with Culture Amp, is proud to present a special workshop: Using Data &amp; Ideation to Bring Company Values to Life. Led by Chloe Hamman and David Osberg of Culture Amp, attendees will work together in small groups through a sequential series of short exercises to learn how to:</p> <p>- Work with their employees and leaders to discover their values or “uncover” important values that haven’t been previously identified</p> <p>- Use employee feedback via surveys and focus groups to identify what employees truly value</p> <p>- Clearly define for each value:</p> <p>- Its meaning</p> <p>- Its business relevance</p> <p>- The social conditions required to bring the value to life in the context of the organization (aka, “mutuality”)</p> <p>- Use ideation techniques to transform abstract values into meaningful, innovative practices that improve employee engagement and business outcomes</p> <p>Courtney Bigony of 15Five will also highlight the process they used to develop specific rituals for each of their values to ensure they’re a meaningful part of the employee experience. Recommendations on how other companies can do the same will be shared. Courtney will explain how companies can incorporate values into their employee feedback and development processes.</p> <p>This workshop is limited to 50 seats so please register early!</p> <p>Link to register: <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/workshop-using-data-ideation-to-bring-company-values-to-life-tickets-46302494006\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/workshop-using-data-ideation-to-bring-company-values-to-life-tickets-46302494006</a></p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>12:00pm - 1:00pm: Networking and Lunch</p> <p>1:00pm - 2:00pm: Workshop</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Tim Engler will give an informal talk about NomicChain, a framework for a decentralized, self-modifying blockchain based on Martin-Löf type theory that encodes the rules for how to process the chain within the chain itself.</p> <p>From Tim:</p> <p>Imagine a set of expressions that act as a \"constitution\" or \"bill of rights\". Each expression would commonly be a function that takes, along with common arguments, one or more proofs of propositions and returns a command that describes an alteration to the \"constitution\" itself (i.e., data describing a creation of a new expression, or an alteration/deletion of an existing one).</p> <p>Now, place this structure in a decentralized p2p network in the format of a blockchain, where each block contains calls to the expression set, thus providing instructions to alter itself.</p> <p>In Idris, this could be represented by a private data structure (which can't be created directly):</p> <p>data CoreCommand : Type where<br/>AlterCommand : {type : Type} -&gt; (namePath : NamePath) -&gt; (value : type) -&gt; CoreCommand<br/>DeleteCommand : (namePath : NamePath)</p> <p>where NamePath represents a canonical way to identify a named global expression and is defined as something like:</p> <p>NamePath : Type<br/>NamePath = List String</p> <p>This talk would discuss some ideas about:</p> <p>* A detailed description on how NomicChain could be built.<br/>* Potential uses for NomicChain. For example, how it could unify the fragmented market of cryptocurrencies, and creating a common service to provide security and communication.<br/>* The differences between so-called \"Proof of Work\", and \"Proof of Stake\", and why I think NomicChain should be initially be designed to work a neutral basis between the two.<br/>* Why I think that NomicChain should ultimately be built without a coin<br/>(this ties into the fragmentation of the cryptocurrency market).</p> <p>After this talk, I'm hoping for feedback as far as the implementation details, as well as the potential uses for a system such as this. I know the some of basics of type theory, but am an amateur at best, and would like to have opinions from others who are more familar with it.</p> ",

Then, we’ll discuss the ways that the Dash community has been using the library and what’s to come in 2018.</p> <p>Dash simplifies web application development through two simple but powerful abstractions: - A declarative Python interface to rich web components rendered with React.js - Interactivity between components through a functional reactive interface where we write code from the perspective of the “outputs” rather than from the “inputs”.</p> <p>Meet your speaker: Chelsea Douglas, Sr Data Visualization Specialist at Plotly. Chelsea is the head of the documentation and support teams at Plotly. As a polyglot in R, MATLAB, Python, and JavaScript, she leads communication of Plotly capabilities to users across programming languages, academic fields, and industries.

The aim is to lead the audience to the understanding, basic elements of analytical method, with a focus on Quality. At the outset, it implores the analytical chemist to grasp an Analytical Method as a process of measurement.</p> <p>They are then lead to understand the concepts of measurement, errors, measurement uncertainty and measurement resolution. The extent of such errors needs to be explored, mitigated, minimized and established for the specific method, as it is being developed. Thus, it presents a goal oriented Method Development with a generic, iterative, sequential and modular approach, leading eventually to the establishment of the validation parameters at the validation stage. Following the initial development, the process continues thru optimization and subsequently to validation. Guidance from EP, USP, ICH Q2 (R)1, AOAC etc. will be discussed.</p> <p>The presentation continually builds on from a conceptual level to practical applications, data handling, data integrity, validation protocol and other documentation, vis-a-vis regulatory requirements. Discussions provide extensive guidance for preparing Methods Validation Protocols for the various stages of regulatory submissions, e.g. IND, NDA, ANDA, PAI CMC etc. Various aspects of laboratory controls, QC procedures, SOPs that cover calibration, standardization, qualification and validation, will be included, along with statistical tools, SQC, SPC for processing and monitoring of analytical data. Strategies for the development stability, indicating assays, are included.</p> <p>This Course is highly interactive and participative. Attendees are encouraged to interact and be prepared to bring examples of Analytical Development and Validation issues, which will be discussed during the second day. A class breakout session (for about 2 hours) is normally included, wherein the attendees will be expected to participate in solving assignments of group exercise. This workshop style session requires and demonstrates the practical applications of the concepts learnt during the two days.

        "description": "<p>This tutorial will cover everything from A to Z of building the backend of an Instagram-like service. We will start with setting up the environment using Vagrant, Python, Postgres, and Django while I help explain best practices for rapidly prototyping an API centric application. From there we will install the required Django plugins (such as Django Rest Framework), build the views and serializes, and handle user authentication. The next component will be dealing with image uploading, applying filters, and saving the data to a CDN capable location (S3). We’ll wrap up the project by creating all the other API endpoints such as getting profile info, liking, commenting, and following. I hope this tutorial series gives you a great idea of the many complexities that exist when building applications.</p> <p>Django boilerplate can be found here: <a href=\"https://github.com/tsavecodes/djawesome\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/tsavecodes/djawesome</a></p> <p>Tutorial overview</p> <p>header<br/>What are the requirements?</p> <p>Python + Django<br/>Databases driven websites (we’ll be using Postgres)<br/>Linux (we’ll be hosting on Ubuntu)<br/>I’ll be developing on a Mac, but since we are using Vagrant any OS should do</p> <p>What is the target audience?</p> <p>Learners who want to understand Django’s structure for big applications<br/>Learners who want to enhance their knowledge of API best practices<br/>Learners who don’t know how to get started building an application</p> ",
